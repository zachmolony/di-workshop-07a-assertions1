You can then clone the folder using
``` git clone https://github.com/<YOUR NAME>/di-workshop-07a-assertions1.git```
(alternatively if you are not going to save the changes you can use)
``` git clone https://github.com/adaapp/di-workshop-07a-assertions1.git```
Open the project using a code editor, such as VS code (```code .```)
### OR
### Open the Repo in Repl.it
Clone the repo to your own account.
Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it), click the IMPORT REPO button at the top left. Copy and paste the address of your repo.
It should look like 
``` git clone https://github.com/<YOUR NAME>/di-workshop-07a-assertions1.git```
If you are not going to save any of the changes, you can use:
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/adaapp/di-workshop-07a-assertions1)](https://repl.it/github/adaapp/di-workshop-07a-assertions1)
You can set the 'run' button to use ```npm test``` if you would like.

### THEN
### Solving Tests
Type ```npm install``` on your terminal or the repl.it terminal to install mocha.
Look at the exercise files. Your goal is to complete the exercises in sequence by getting the tests to pass. You can try the tests using ```npm test```. See the instructions in the test files.

### Saving tests
The workshop will be set up to allow you to save your changes.
For this, you should use ```git add .``` to 'stage' all files, i.e. prepare them to be committed, git ```git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE"``` to register the changes, then ```git push origin master``` to save your changes to the server. You should get into the habit of doing this after every completed exercise.
