// type coersion in javascript means that if you try to add together or compare
// different data types, it will generally let you, but this will not necessarily
// lead to the result you were hoping for. for more information, see:
// https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839/
// it's also worth noting that if you compare arrays or objects, you're actually 
// comparing references to memory locations, so even if the contents are the same, 
// if the arrays or objects were created independently they will not register as equal
